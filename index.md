# Zachary Braden

## local nerd with too much free time

Yo, my name is Zach, though most know me as Kobrakon, and I am a Computer Hardware Specialist and Programmer experienced with JS, C#, C++, and I'm currently learning Python, Unity, and UE5. I work on various programs and mods for games and the such.

Along with programming, I also do work relating to modeling, animating, and creating environment soundscape music.
